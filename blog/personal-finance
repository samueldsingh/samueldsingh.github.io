# Pesonal finance dashboard in excel

Our objective is to build a personal finance dashboard based on our income and budget.  

The steps followed to create the interactive dashboard are:

1. Create a pivot table for the spendings and budget.
2. Insert slicers for the month using the pivot tables.
3. To obtain the colored data bars, go to conditional formatting --> Data Bars --> More Rules --> Maximum --> Number --> Total Budget Value (From Pivot Table).
4. To obtain the "Expense by Category" chart again use the actual spendings table.
5. Report connections with the Actuals table.
6. Use the pivot table again to obtain the change in cash and starting cash balance chart.
7. Use the budget table to obtain the planned expense and planned income values.
