# Creating an interactive sales dashboard in excel

Our objective is to build an interactive sales dashboard on Adidas sales that dynamically updates based on our preferences with the year, the product, the region and more.  

The steps followed to create the interactive dashboard are:

1. Create a pivot table between the year and total sales
2. Create a visualization by going to PivotTable Analyze --> PivotChart
3. Create a pivot table between the states and sales and generate a map by going to Insert --> Map
4. Find the trend between the different retailers and sales generated, create a pivot table and then obtain a bar chart
5. Create a donut chart between sales method and total sales
6. Finally we can make the excel interactive by inserting slicers for years, products and regions.
7. By selecting slicer --> Report Connections we can connect the year, sales, retailers and sales method.
